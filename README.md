# Airline-Review-Analysis
Analyzing Online Reviews of Singapore Airlines from September 2018 to March 2024

The Purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in data visualization, dashboard creation and performing sentiment analysis on written reviews using [NLTK VADER](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.vader.html) for python (module citation found at bottom of README). The Dataset I used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/singapore-airlines-reviews) at Kaggle.com. And finally, the Dashboard which is the end product of this project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/travis.wolf1141/viz/AirlineReviews_17187414963740/Dashboard1) on Tableau Public.
